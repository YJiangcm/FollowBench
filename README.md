# FollowBench: A Multi-level Fine-grained Constraints Following Benchmark for Large Language Models (ACL 2024)

We introduce **FollowBench**, a Multi-level Fine-grained Constraints Following Benchmark for **systemically** and **precisely** evaluate the instruction-following capability of LLMs.
- **FollowBench** comprehensively includes five different types (i.e., Content, Situation, Style, Format, and Example) of _fine-grained constraints_. 
- To enable a precise constraint following estimation on diverse difficulties, we introduce a _Multi-level_ mechanism that incrementally adds a single constraint to the initial instruction at each increased level. 
- To evaluate whether LLMs' outputs have satisfied every individual constraint, we propose to prompt strong LLMs with _constraint-evolution paths_ to handle challenging open-ended instructions.
- By evaluating **13** closed-source and open-source popular LLMs on FollowBench, we highlight the weaknesses of LLMs in instruction following and point towards potential avenues for future work.

### Metrics
* **Hard Satisfaction Rate (HSR):** the average rate at which all constraints of individual instructions are fully satisfied
* **Soft Satisfaction Rate (SSR):** the average satisfaction rate of individual constraints across all instructions
* **Consistent Satisfaction Levels (CSL):** how many consecutive levels a model can satisfy, beginning from level 1

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Evaluate on FollowBench

#### Install Dependencies

```
conda create -n followbench python=3.10
conda activate followbench
conda install pytorch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 torchaudio==0.13.1 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Model Inference
```bash
cd FollowBench/
python code/model_inference_vllm.py --model_path <model_name_or_path>
```

#### LLM-based Evaluation
```bash
cd FollowBench/
python code/llm_eval.py --model_path <model_name_or_path> --api_key <your_own_gpt4_api_key>
```

#### Merge Evaluation and Save Results 
Next, we conduct **rule-based evaluation** and merge the **rule-based evaluation** results and **LLM-based evaluation** results using the following script:
```bash
cd FollowBench/
python code/eval.py --model_paths <a_list_of_evaluated_models>
```
The final results will be saved in the folder named ```evaluation_result```.
