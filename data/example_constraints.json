Restoring Snake River salmon to healthy, \n        self-sustaining, harvestable levels will have significant \n        economic benefits for these communities.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds and declares the following:\n            (1) Certain species of salmon and steelhead in the Columbia \n        and Snake River Basin are on the brink of extinction as a \n        consequence of various factors, including hydroelectric \n        projects, harvest management practices, habitat degradation, \n        altered in stream flow, and unsound hatchery practices.\n            (2) These salmon and steelhead have major economic, \n        ecological, educational, recreational, scientific, cultural, \n        and spiritual significance to the Nation and its people.\n            (3) The Federal Government and ratepayers in the Pacific \n        Northwest have spent more than $6,000,000,000 on salmon \n        recovery efforts.\n            (4) Thirteen salmon and steelhead species in the Columbia \n        and Snake River Basin are listed for protections under the \n        Endangered Species Act of 1973 (6 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n            (5) Salmon and steelhead extinction could cost taxpayers \n        billions of dollars.\n            (6) Salmon and steelhead are symbols of the Pacific \n        Northwest, support thousands of jobs in coastal and inland \n        communities, and serve as an indicator of the health of \n        Northern California and Pacific Northwest river ecosystems.\n            (7) Salmon and steelhead of the Snake River are a vital \n        economic resource to communities in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, \n        Idaho, and California. Restoring Snake River salmon to healthy, \n        self-sustaining, harvestable levels will have significant \n        economic benefits for these communities. Understanding these \n        benefits is imperative to setting public policy on salmon \n        restoration efforts in the Northwest.\n            (8) The original range of Snake River salmon included not \n        only their existing habitat in...'}\n\nGiven a summary of a bill: Power Marketing Administration Reform Act of 1998 - Requires the Secretary of Energy to develop and implement procedures to ensure that the Federal Power Marketing Administrations (FPMAs) utilize the same accounting principles and requirements as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) applies to the electric operations of public utilities. \n(Sec. 4) Requires each FPMA and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to submit periodically for FERC review rates for the sale or disposition of Federal energy that will ensure recovery of all their costs in generating and marketing such energy. \nPrescribes rate mechanism and pricing guidelines. \nEstablishes a fund within the Department of the Interior to:  (1) mitigate damage to environmental resources attributable to power generation and sales facilities; and (2) restore the health of such resources, including fish and wildlife.  Mandates project-specific mitigation plans for each power generation project. \nEstablishes a fund within the Department of Energy for renewable resources.  Prescribes expenditure guidelines. \nMandates that public bodies and cooperatives be given a preference for future power allocations or reallocations of Federal power through a right of first refusal at market prices. \nInstructs the Secretary of Energy to require each FPMA to:  (1) assign personnel and incur expenses solely for authorized power marketing, reclamation, and flood control activities, and not for diversification into ancillary activities; and (2) make annual public disclosures of its activities, including the full costs of power projects and marketing. \nPrecludes an FPMA from entering into or renewing any power marketing contract for a term exceeding five years. \n(Sec. 5) Requires provision of FPMA transmission services on an open access basis, and at FERC-approved rates in the same manner as provided by any public utility under FERC jurisdiction. \n(Sec. 6) Grants FERC rate-making approval authority until a full transition is made to market-based rates, for:  (1) rate....\nPlease write the title of this summary.\n{'answer': 'Power Marketing Administration Reform Act of 1998'}\n\nGiven a summary: People for the Planet Act of 2008 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish in the Treasury the Environmental Protection Trust Fund to promote ecosystem restoration, reforestation, reclamation of timber roads in national forests, watershed protection, preservation of Great Lakes and other bodies of water, and funding of biodiversity partnerships. Allows individual taxpayers (other than nonresident aliens) to designate on their income tax returns a payment of $3 of their income tax liability to such Trust Fund.\n\nMakes permanent the tax deduction for individual and corporate contributions of conservation easements.\n\nAllows a tax deduction for reforestation expenditures.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that the government should encourage biodiversity partnerships., we want to generate a title from this summary.\nThe response of the AI assistant is: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to promote environmental protection and generate preservation efforts, and for other purposes.\n\nGiven the title: \"Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997\" and the summary of a bill: Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997 - Directs the President to report periodically to specified congressional committees on foreign persons (except those previously identified or sanctioned or subject to waiver) who, on or after August 8, 1995, have transferred, or attempted to transfer, controlled goods or technology, or provided, or attempted to provide, technical assistance or facilities that contributed, or would have contributed, to Iran's efforts to acquire, develop, or produce ballistic missiles. \nRequires imposition on such persons of minimum two-year sanctions prohibiting:  (1) sales to such persons of items on the United States Munitions List (and terminating sales of any controlled U.S. arms); (2) the export to such persons of dual use goods and technology; and (3) the provision of U.S. financial assistance.

        "instruction": "Context: On 21 September, 2015, Canadians Robert Hall and John Ridsdel, as well as Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad, and  Marites Flor; a Filipino woman, were abducted on Samai island near Davao. Ridsdel was beheaded by Abu Sayyaf on 25 April 2016 following a ransom deadline. ASG reportedly demanded more than $8.1 million for Ridsdel and the others. On 3 May, 2016, a video of the Ridsdel execution was released, along with new demands for the remaining hostages. A masked captor said, \"Note to the Philippine government and to the Canadian government: The lesson is clear. John Ridsdel has been beheaded. Now there are three remaining captives here. If you procrastinate once again the negotiations, we will behead this all anytime\". On 15 May, Hall  appeared in a new video, announcing that he and Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad would be decapitated at 3pm on Monday 13 June absent a ransom of $16 million. Both hostages wore orange coveralls, similar to hostages in videos produced by ISIL, to which Abu Sayyaf had previously pledged allegiance. The deadline passed. Hall was beheaded. On 24 June, Abu Sayyaf released Filipina Marites Flor. She was subsequently flown to Davao to meet President-elect Rodrigo Duterte. Duterte said he directed negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf. He did not elaborate. On 17 September, 2016, remaining hostage Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad was released on Jolo island. Abu Ramie, an ASG spokesman, claimed $638,000 was paid as ransom.\nI am trying to figure out the answer to the question from the above context.  Can you tell me the answer?\nQuestion: What happened first, a video of the Risdel execution being released or the release of Kjartan Sekkingstad?\nAnswer:\nAI assistant: video of the Ridsdel execution\n\nContext:  Trying to halt a two-game losing streak, the Ravens traveled to MetLife for one of their two straight games there. The Ravens had a chance to win the game by driving down the field in the final seconds, but the Giants defense held the Ravens back as Flacco threw an incompletion on the final play, dropping the Ravens to 3-3 and their second three-game losing streak in a year.

The International Military Tribunal for the Far East found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27.1 per cent , seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians. While 37,583 prisoners from the UK, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were released after the surrender of Japan, the number of Chinese released was only 56. At least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the East Asia Development Board, or K\u014dain, for work in mines and war industries. After 1942, the number reached 10 million. In Java, between 4 and 10 million r\u014dmusha , were forced to work by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East Asia, and only 52,000 were repatriated to Java.\nI am trying to figure out the answer to the question from the above context.

After both teams initial possession ended in punts, the Patriots drove to the Ravens 19 before settling for a Gostkowski field goal. On the first play of the Ravens' next drive, Steve Gregory intercepted Joe Flacco at the 42 and returned it 36 yards to the Ravens 6-yard line. Three plays later Brandon Bolden ran in a 2-yard touchdown, extending the lead to 10-0. Following another Ravens punt, the Patriots may have missed a chance to put the game away. After driving to the Ravens 27, an offensive pass interference penalty on Rob Gronkowski moved the ball to the Ravens 30. Then, a 19-yard reception on 2-and-11 was nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty moved the ball back to the Ravens 40, eventually ending in a 49-yard Gostkowski field goal, keeping the Ravens in the game. This time the Ravens finally managed a response driving 80 yards to score to score on a 25-yard touchdown pass from Flacco to Torrey Smith, trimming the score to 13-7. On the drive, Jerod Mayo was called for pass interference on 3rd-and-6 and Flacco completed a 14-yard pass on 3rd-and-13. Following a Patriots punt, the Ravens marched 92 yards in over 6 minutes to take a 14-13 lead on a 20-yard touchdown reception by Dennis Pitta.

Ridsdel was beheaded by Abu Sayyaf on 25 April 2016 following a ransom deadline. ASG reportedly demanded more than $8.1 million for Ridsdel and the others. On 3 May, 2016, a video of the Ridsdel execution was released, along with new demands for the remaining hostages. A masked captor said, \"Note to the Philippine government and to the Canadian government: The lesson is clear. John Ridsdel has been beheaded. Now there are three remaining captives here. If you procrastinate once again the negotiations, we will behead this all anytime\". On 15 May, Hall  appeared in a new video, announcing that he and Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad would be decapitated at 3pm on Monday 13 June absent a ransom of $16 million. Both hostages wore orange coveralls, similar to hostages in videos produced by ISIL, to which Abu Sayyaf had previously pledged allegiance. The deadline passed. Hall was beheaded. On 24 June, Abu Sayyaf released Filipina Marites Flor. She was subsequently flown to Davao to meet President-elect Rodrigo Duterte. Duterte said he directed negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf. He did not elaborate. On 17 September, 2016, remaining hostage Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad was released on Jolo island. Abu Ramie, an ASG spokesman, claimed $638,000 was paid as ransom.\nQuestion :\n[Answer]\nWhat happened first, a video of the Risdel execution being released or the release of Kjartan Sekkingstad?\n\nPassage:  Trying to halt a two-game losing streak, the Ravens traveled to MetLife for one of their two straight games there. The Ravens had a chance to win the game by driving down the field in the final seconds, but the Giants defense held the Ravens back as Flacco threw an incompletion on the final play, dropping the Ravens to 3-3 and their second three-game losing streak in a year. The Ravens defense allowed Beckham two 60+ yard touchdowns, helping the Giants win.\nQuestion: How many losing streaks of 3+ games did the Ravens experience on the year?\nAnswer:\n{'response': '2'}\n\nI am trying to figure out the answer to the question, \"How many prisoners all together were released after the  surrender of Japan?\" I found the following text-snippet has the answer. Can you tell me the answer?\n\nJapanese prisoner-of-war camps, many of which were used as labour camps, also had high death rates. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27.1 per cent , seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians. While 37,583 prisoners from the UK, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were released after the surrender of Japan, the number of Chinese released was only 56. At least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the East Asia Development Board, or K\u014dain, for work in mines and war industries. After 1942, the number reached 10 million. In Java, between 4 and 10 million r\u014dmusha , were forced to work by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East Asia, and only 52,000 were repatriated to Java.\nThe response of the bot is: 80556\n\nContext:  The Patriots were hoping to stave off a losing streak and rebound from their loss to the Cardinals in this rematch of the AFC Championship. After both teams initial possession ended in punts, the Patriots drove to the Ravens 19 before settling for a Gostkowski field goal. On the first play of the Ravens' next drive, Steve Gregory intercepted Joe Flacco at the 42 and returned it 36 yards to the Ravens 6-yard line. Three plays later Brandon Bolden ran in a 2-yard touchdown, extending the lead to 10-0. Following another Ravens punt, the Patriots may have missed a chance to put the game away. After driving to the Ravens 27, an offensive pass interference penalty on Rob Gronkowski moved the ball to the Ravens 30. Then, a 19-yard reception on 2-and-11 was nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty moved the ball back to the Ravens 40, eventually ending in a 49-yard Gostkowski field goal, keeping the Ravens in the game. This time the Ravens finally managed a response driving 80 yards to score to score on a 25-yard touchdown pass from Flacco to Torrey Smith, trimming the score to 13-7. On the drive, Jerod Mayo was called for pass interference on 3rd-and-6 and Flacco completed a 14-yard pass on 3rd-and-13. Following a Patriots punt, the Ravens marched 92 yards in over 6 minutes to take a 14-13 lead on a 20-yard touchdown reception by Dennis Pitta. The Patriots took the lead right back marching 81 yards and never faced a third-down, taking the lead on a 7-yard touchdown reception by Edelman for a 20-14 halftime lead. In the second half the Ravens took the opening drive 80 yards and scored on a 7-yard touchdown run by Ray Rice to allow Baltimore to retake a 21-20 lead. Again the Patriots took the lead right back on a 12 play, 78-yard march to take a 27-21 lead on a 3-yard touchdown run by Danny Woodhead. Following a Ravens punt the Patriots drove all the way to the Ravens 2-yard line, but had to settle for a 20-yard field goal, making the score 30-21 early in the fourth quarter. The Ravens proceeded to drive...\nI am trying to figure out the answer to the question from the above context.  Can you tell me the answer?\nQuestion: How many points did the Ravens win by?\nAnswer:\nAI assistant: 1\n\nQuestion: Who did Vlad \u0162epe\u015f want mobilized?\nAnswer based on following passage.\n\nVlad \u0162epe\u015f asked the Hungarian king for assistance.  He received no support despite promises made by Corvinus and instead called for a mobilization that included \"not only men of military age, but also of women and of children from the age of twelve up; and included Gypsy slave contingents.\" Various sources mention the strength of his army to be between 22,000 and 30,900, with the most popular accepted number set at 30,000. The letter of Leonardo Tocco which put the numbers of the Turkish army at an exaggerated strength of 400,000, exaggerated also the Wallachian strength which was estimated at 200,000. The majority of the army consisted of peasants and shepherds, while the boyars on horseback\u2014who were few in numbers\u2014were armed with lances, swords, and daggers and wore chainmail as armour. Vlad's personal guard consisted of mercenaries from many countries and some Gypsies. Before battle, it is believed that Vlad told his men that \"it would be better that those who think of death should not follow me\".\n\nAnswer:\nBot: men of military age, women and of children, Gypsy slave contingents\n\nContext: Hoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the Packers, the Vikings played their Week 2 home opener against the Indianapolis Colts.

Additional costs of maintaining the device and battery replacement drive the costs higher. In reality however the overall economic impact of the devices is just about the same as treatment of high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol when life years (a commonly applied economic marker) is considered. As with the harms, the benefits are not quantified. The story says up high that patients who fell outside the guidelines had a \u201chigher risk of dying in the hospital and of complications from the implantation.\u201d But there are no numbers provided. In fact, there are more percentages provided in this story about the stock prices of the various device makers involved than there are about the harms or benefits. This is the Wall Street Journal, of course, but we still thought some additional numbers about harms or benefits would have been helpful to any reader. The story attempts to evaluate the quality of the evidence, but it falls short. In comparing the way this story brings context to the shocking findings to the way the LA Times does, this story is confusing and potentially misleading. We have read these paragraphs several times and still are not sure what they mean: Did these patients attempt to sign up for clinical trials and were denied? And what is the bill that the 22.5% will not fit? The LA Times story examines the study in much clearer language and provides the right context. The story does not engage in disease-mongering. We spent some time on the fence...\nThe response of the bot is: likely false\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: Pill Treats Painful Fibroids\n\nPassage: The story does not describe costs of the drug. The story states that 80 to 95% of women have no bleeding after taking the drug. However, that leaves a lot of open questions about the effectiveness of the drug. For example, how long does this benefit last? What about other symptoms of fibroids like abdominal pain and pressure? The story repeatedly mentions that the drug shrinks fibroids. By how much? Is that difference clinically meaningful? In other words, can women perceive an improvement in bulk symptoms\u00a0(pain, pressure) as a result of the decreased fibroid size? Do the fibroids grow back? The story mentions the potential harm of elevated liver function test results. However, it does not explain\u00a0 that women commonly experience abdominal pain, headaches and nausea with this drug. The story does not critically appraise the current study. This was a small study (57 patients) with a short follow-up time. The results have also yet to be fully evaluated and have only been presented at a scientific conference. The story verges on disease mongering by exaggerating the seriousness of fibroids. While it is true that up to 80% of women may have fibroids, only about 20% of women will have symptoms that are bothersome enough that they would seek treatment. Fibroids in of themselves are benign and are not problematic unless they cause symptoms and treatment should only be initiated if a woman is bothered by them. Symptoms of fibroids also most often go away after menopause. However, this story leaves the impression that all women with fibroids should be treated. The story quoted multiple independent experts. The story mentions Lupron and Uterine Artery Embolization as alternatives to EllaOne but fails to mention many other safe and effective options that are currently available. For example, oral contraceptives (which are not approved for fibroids but are commonly used for that indication) can help reduce bleeding and cramping associated with fibroids. Likewise, the Mirena IUD often stops bleeding altogether. NSAIDs can...\nThe response of the bot is: definitely false\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: Heart Failure Drug Shows Promise in First Human Trial\n\nPassage: There is no mention of the cost for the tested drug, cimaglermin, in this story. The costs for regularly prescribed drugs for the medical condition that\u2019s the focus of the study \u2014 weakened left ventricular function \u2014 are well known and although cimaglermin is an experimental drug, it should be possible to predict whether the new drug would be comparatively priced, cheaper or more expensive. Readers would benefit from that knowledge. While this story discusses that the drug seemed to benefit patients and was effective, it doesn\u2019t say how that was measured, and by how much the measurement improved due to the drug. (By digging into the research paper, via figure 3, we found that the benefits were measured by tracking absolute increases in\u00a0ejection fraction, which is the amount of blood pumped out the ventricles. It increased 8% in the group receiving a medium or high dose of the medicine.) One issue that might be confusing for readers: The story notes that a \u201cphase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, then why is the framing of the story about how effective it was? The story clearly points out that side effects included nausea and headaches, and that one participant did experience abnormal liver function after receiving the highest dose, a side effect that eventually cleared up. This is a strong point of the story: It clearly establishes that this was a small phase one randomized controlled trial, and the story explains what that means for the drug\u2019s development. A phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Before cimaglermin could be used to treat patients, it must prove its worth in a series of progressively larger and challenging trials and then be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The process can take several years. Based on these preliminary findings, larger trials are being planned, Lenihan said. But, as noted in quantify benefits criterion above, readers...\nThe response of the bot is: definitely true\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: New Tools for Helping Heart Patients\n\nPassage: \"Mixed bag. The story explained that the devices \"\"can cost as much as $30,000.\"\" And there was one data point from one study on one device that users\u2019 hospital costs were $1,600 less per admission. But the device costs are variable and device performance will be variable. We\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt but it painted the cost picture with really broad strokes. Information about the potential to increase longevity was presented from a study that has not yet been published. The information was presented as a relative increase rather than an absolute increase. The story didn\u2019t contain sufficient information to quantify the benefit to any specific group of patients. The story did mention the problem of potential information overload however there was no discussion of actual harm such as inappropriate shocks from implanted defibrillator devices, for example. There was no questioning of the accuracy of the data potentially transmitted by devices. This was a far too rosy picture \u2013 almost as if all the data was so terrific that the only downside could be the volume of terrific data. Other things can go wrong as past experience shows when you try to regulate the heart. In our eyes, a red flag went up when the story cited \"\"a paper under review.\"\" We don\u2019t know the quality of the paper nor have peer reviewers completed their review yet. So that\u2019s giving the researcher free rein to say whatever he wants about that study. We also must address the headline which stated \u2018New tools for helping heart patients\u2019 before we have concrete demonstration that the new tools actually do help. The story opened with an anecdote that implied that something terrible was avoided. That, of course, is always hard to know. The punch line is that without the device reporting in to a clinician, the situation was one in which it \u00a0\"\"could have gone for months before the problem was discovered.\"\" The story never considered the question of whether there is always value in immediate recognition of a situation. Clinicians who were...\nThe response of the bot is: definitely false\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: Seven presidents before (Barack Obama) -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans.\n\nPassage: \"President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law has been one of the most polarizing aspects of his presidency, with Republicans criticizing it at every turn. But the keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, didn\u2019t run from it. He applauded Obama for pursuing expanded health care -- and succeeding where his predecessors had failed. \"\"Seven presidents before him -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans,\"\" Castro said. \"\"President Obama got it done.\"\" We wondered whether Castro\u2019s history was correct. So we checked with a variety of public policy and health care historians and found that Castro\u2019s in the ballpark -- but that a lot of caveats are in order. Let\u2019s start with the presidents who almost certainly fit Castro\u2019s definition of having \"\"tried to expand health care to all Americans.\"\" \u2022 Harry Truman. On Nov. 19, 1945, Truman wrote a message to Congress saying that \"\"the health of American children, like their education, should be recognized as a definite public responsibility.\"\" According to the Truman Library, \"\"the most controversial aspect of the plan was the proposed national health insurance plan.\"\" It called for \"\"the creation of a national health insurance fund to be run by the federal government. This fund would be open to all Americans, but would remain optional. Participants would pay monthly fees into the plan, which would cover the cost of any and all medical expenses that arose in a time of need. The government would pay for the cost of services rendered by any doctor who chose to join the program.\"\" The American Medical Association attacked the plan, characterizing the bill as \"\"socialized medicine.\"\" Truman ultimately abandoned the effort after the outbreak of the Korean War \u2022 Richard Nixon. In 1971 and 1974, Nixon offered separate proposals to expand health insurance to all, or nearly all, Americans. Generally speaking, they involved employer mandates to provide health insurance, supplemented by...\nThe response of the bot is: definitely true\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: Massage Therapy May Boost Immune System to Combat Cold, Flu\n\nPassage: Since there was no mention of costs in this news release. It would have been helpful to readers to discuss the approximate cost of a massage session, which can vary widely depending on the region, therapist and setting. The Center for Spirituality & Healing at the University of Minnesota estimates the national average for an hour-long massage to be about $60. Many people may wonder if their insurance policy would cover a massage therapy session. Insurance companies rarely pay for massage therapy, particularly for indications that aren\u2019t backed by science or evidence. The news release cited three studies, but descriptions of the research were too vague to be helpful. Readers aren\u2019t given any benefit data or any quantitative estimate on how well massage therapy actually works. We don\u2019t know how many participants were in each trial and who actually benefited from massage therapy. The release alludes to the fact several times that the immune system became stronger, but how was this measured? There are also non-specific references to the benefits of massage therapy, such as increasing the activity of white blood cells and reducing anxiety levels, but again, we don\u2019t know who actually benefited and by how much. When we looked at the studies cited we were surprised to find that none of them related to massage therapy for reducing rates of the \u201ccommon cold, flu and other seasonal illnesses,\u201d as claimed in the release. The first study was from 2010 and is described by its authors as \u201cpreliminary\u201d work that looks at a \u201csingle-session comparison of Swedish Massage Therapy with a light touch control condition\u201d measuring \u00a0\u201cOxytocin (OT), arginine-vasopressin (AVP), adrenal corticotropin hormone (ACTH), cortisol (CORT), circulating phenotypic lymphocytes markers, and mitogen-stimulated cytokine production.\u201d\u00a0 This study is far removed from patient-oriented, or even disease-oriented outcomes, and has nothing to do with their sweeping comments that massage may fend off flu and the common cold.

Additional costs of maintaining the device and battery replacement drive the costs higher. In reality however the overall economic impact of the devices is just about the same as treatment of high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol when life years (a commonly applied economic marker) is considered. As with the harms, the benefits are not quantified. The story says up high that patients who fell outside the guidelines had a \u201chigher risk of dying in the hospital and of complications from the implantation.\u201d But there are no numbers provided. In fact, there are more percentages provided in this story about the stock prices of the various device makers involved than there are about the harms or benefits. This is the Wall Street Journal, of course, but we still thought some additional numbers about harms or benefits would have been helpful to any reader. The story attempts to evaluate the quality of the evidence, but it falls short. In comparing the way this story brings context to the shocking findings to the way the LA Times does, this story is confusing and potentially misleading. We have read these paragraphs several times and still are not sure what they mean: Did these patients attempt to sign up for clinical trials and were denied? And what is the bill that the 22.5% will not fit? The LA Times story examines the study in much clearer language and provides the right context. The story does not engage in disease-mongering. We spent some time on the fence...\nThe response of the bot is: likely false\n\nAfter reading:\n\n The story does not describe costs of the drug. The story states that 80 to 95% of women have no bleeding after taking the drug. However, that leaves a lot of open questions about the effectiveness of the drug. For example, how long does this benefit last? What about other symptoms of fibroids like abdominal pain and pressure? The story repeatedly mentions that the drug shrinks fibroids. By how much? Is that difference clinically meaningful? In other words, can women perceive an improvement in bulk symptoms\u00a0(pain, pressure) as a result of the decreased fibroid size? Do the fibroids grow back? The story mentions the potential harm of elevated liver function test results. However, it does not explain\u00a0 that women commonly experience abdominal pain, headaches and nausea with this drug. The story does not critically appraise the current study. This was a small study (57 patients) with a short follow-up time. The results have also yet to be fully evaluated and have only been presented at a scientific conference. The story verges on disease mongering by exaggerating the seriousness of fibroids. While it is true that up to 80% of women may have fibroids, only about 20% of women will have symptoms that are bothersome enough that they would seek treatment. Fibroids in of themselves are benign and are not problematic unless they cause symptoms and treatment should only be initiated if a woman is bothered by them. Symptoms of fibroids also most often go away after menopause. However, this story leaves the impression that all women with fibroids should be treated. The story quoted multiple independent experts. The story mentions Lupron and Uterine Artery Embolization as alternatives to EllaOne but fails to mention many other safe and effective options that are currently available. For example, oral contraceptives (which are not approved for fibroids but are commonly used for that indication) can help reduce bleeding and cramping associated with fibroids.

A phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Before cimaglermin could be used to treat patients, it must prove its worth in a series of progressively larger and challenging trials and then be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

It would have been helpful to readers to discuss the approximate cost of a massage session, which can vary widely depending on the region, therapist and setting. The Center for Spirituality & Healing at the University of Minnesota estimates the national average for an hour-long massage to be about $60. Many people may wonder if their insurance policy would cover a massage therapy session. Insurance companies rarely pay for massage therapy, particularly for indications that aren\u2019t backed by science or evidence. The news release cited three studies, but descriptions of the research were too vague to be helpful. Readers aren\u2019t given any benefit data or any quantitative estimate on how well massage therapy actually works. We don\u2019t know how many participants were in each trial and who actually benefited from massage therapy. The release alludes to the fact several times that the immune system became stronger, but how was this measured? There are also non-specific references to the benefits of massage therapy, such as increasing the activity of white blood cells and reducing anxiety levels, but again, we don\u2019t know who actually benefited and by how much. When we looked at the studies cited we were surprised to find that none of them related to massage therapy for reducing rates of the \u201ccommon cold, flu and other seasonal illnesses,\u201d as claimed in the release. The first study was from 2010 and is described by its authors as \u201cpreliminary\u201d work that looks at a \u201csingle-session comparison of Swedish Massage Therapy with a light touch control condition\u201d measuring \u00a0\u201cOxytocin (OT), arginine-vasopressin (AVP), adrenal corticotropin hormone (ACTH), cortisol (CORT), circulating phenotypic lymphocytes markers, and mitogen-stimulated cytokine production.\u201d\u00a0 This study is far removed from patient-oriented, or even disease-oriented outcomes, and has nothing to do with their sweeping comments that massage may fend off flu and the common cold.

A new study presented at this week\u2019s European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology shows that EllaOne, currently available as an emergency contraceptive in Europe (but not in the US), may shrink fibroids and reduce symptoms relative to placebo. However, the results should be greeted cautiously. This was a small, short study and the full results have not been evaluated. More research is needed to confirm them and answer many outstanding questions. Whilet EllaOne may be shown to\u00a0 be very helpful to women with fibroids in the future, these results are\u00a0premature at best.\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: Heart Failure Drug Shows Promise in First Human Trial\n\nPassage: There is no mention of the cost for the tested drug, cimaglermin, in this story. The costs for regularly prescribed drugs for the medical condition that\u2019s the focus of the study \u2014 weakened left ventricular function \u2014 are well known and although cimaglermin is an experimental drug, it should be possible to predict whether the new drug would be comparatively priced, cheaper or more expensive. Readers would benefit from that knowledge. While this story discusses that the drug seemed to benefit patients and was effective, it doesn\u2019t say how that was measured, and by how much the measurement improved due to the drug. (By digging into the research paper, via figure 3, we found that the benefits were measured by tracking absolute increases in\u00a0ejection fraction, which is the amount of blood pumped out the ventricles. It increased 8% in the group receiving a medium or high dose of the medicine.) One issue that might be confusing for readers: The story notes that a \u201cphase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, then why is the framing of the story about how effective it was? The story clearly points out that side effects included nausea and headaches, and that one participant did experience abnormal liver function after receiving the highest dose, a side effect that eventually cleared up. This is a strong point of the story: It clearly establishes that this was a small phase one randomized controlled trial, and the story explains what that means for the drug\u2019s development. A phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Before cimaglermin could be used to treat patients, it must prove its worth in a series of progressively larger and challenging trials and then be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The process can take several years. Based on these preliminary findings, larger trials are being planned, Lenihan said. But, as noted in quantify benefits criterion above, readers...\nThe response of the bot is: definitely true\n\nI  could not conclude:\n\nNew Tools for Helping Heart Patients\n\nfrom:\n\n\"Mixed bag. The story explained that the devices \"\"can cost as much as $30,000.\"\" And there was one data point from one study on one device that users\u2019 hospital costs were $1,600 less per admission. But the device costs are variable and device performance will be variable. We\u2019ll give the story the benefit of the doubt but it painted the cost picture with really broad strokes. Information about the potential to increase longevity was presented from a study that has not yet been published. The information was presented as a relative increase rather than an absolute increase. The story didn\u2019t contain sufficient information to quantify the benefit to any specific group of patients. The story did mention the problem of potential information overload however there was no discussion of actual harm such as inappropriate shocks from implanted defibrillator devices, for example. There was no questioning of the accuracy of the data potentially transmitted by devices. This was a far too rosy picture \u2013 almost as if all the data was so terrific that the only downside could be the volume of terrific data. Other things can go wrong as past experience shows when you try to regulate the heart. In our eyes, a red flag went up when the story cited \"\"a paper under review.\"\" We don\u2019t know the quality of the paper nor have peer reviewers completed their review yet. So that\u2019s giving the researcher free rein to say whatever he wants about that study. We also must address the headline which stated \u2018New tools for helping heart patients\u2019 before we have concrete demonstration that the new tools actually do help. The story opened with an anecdote that implied that something terrible was avoided. That, of course, is always hard to know. The punch line is that without the device reporting in to a clinician, the situation was one in which it \u00a0\"\"could have gone for months before the problem was discovered.\"\" The story never considered the question of whether there is always value in immediate recognition of a situation. Clinicians who were...\n\nbecause of:\n#Answer#\n\"This is a classic story of the potential promise of a new technology\u00a0for the health care sector.

It would have been helpful to readers to discuss the approximate cost of a massage session, which can vary widely depending on the region, therapist and setting. The Center for Spirituality & Healing at the University of Minnesota estimates the national average for an hour-long massage to be about $60. Many people may wonder if their insurance policy would cover a massage therapy session. Insurance companies rarely pay for massage therapy, particularly for indications that aren\u2019t backed by science or evidence. The news release cited three studies, but descriptions of the research were too vague to be helpful. Readers aren\u2019t given any benefit data or any quantitative estimate on how well massage therapy actually works. We don\u2019t know how many participants were in each trial and who actually benefited from massage therapy. The release alludes to the fact several times that the immune system became stronger, but how was this measured? There are also non-specific references to the benefits of massage therapy, such as increasing the activity of white blood cells and reducing anxiety levels, but again, we don\u2019t know who actually benefited and by how much. When we looked at the studies cited we were surprised to find that none of them related to massage therapy for reducing rates of the \u201ccommon cold, flu and other seasonal illnesses,\u201d as claimed in the release. The first study was from 2010 and is described by its authors as \u201cpreliminary\u201d work that looks at a \u201csingle-session comparison of Swedish Massage Therapy with a light touch control condition\u201d measuring \u00a0\u201cOxytocin (OT), arginine-vasopressin (AVP), adrenal corticotropin hormone (ACTH), cortisol (CORT), circulating phenotypic lymphocytes markers, and mitogen-stimulated cytokine production.\u201d\u00a0 This study is far removed from patient-oriented, or even disease-oriented outcomes, and has nothing to do with their sweeping comments that massage may fend off flu and the common cold.

Additional costs of maintaining the device and battery replacement drive the costs higher. In reality however the overall economic impact of the devices is just about the same as treatment of high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol when life years (a commonly applied economic marker) is considered. As with the harms, the benefits are not quantified. The story says up high that patients who fell outside the guidelines had a \u201chigher risk of dying in the hospital and of complications from the implantation.\u201d But there are no numbers provided. In fact, there are more percentages provided in this story about the stock prices of the various device makers involved than there are about the harms or benefits. This is the Wall Street Journal, of course, but we still thought some additional numbers about harms or benefits would have been helpful to any reader. The story attempts to evaluate the quality of the evidence, but it falls short. In comparing the way this story brings context to the shocking findings to the way the LA Times does, this story is confusing and potentially misleading. We have read these paragraphs several times and still are not sure what they mean: Did these patients attempt to sign up for clinical trials and were denied? And what is the bill that the 22.5% will not fit? The LA Times story examines the study in much clearer language and provides the right context. The story does not engage in disease-mongering. We spent some time on the fence...\n\nI  do not think it is completely true that:\n\nMore Than 22% of Heart-Device Implantations Aren\u2019t In Line With Guidelines\n\nis true because of:\n{'AI assistant': 'This blog post about a study revealing some new data about the overuse of heart implants does some things quite well, but it falls short on a number of our measures. See the Los Angeles Times piece which we also reviewed for comparison. While The WSJ blog includes cost information, which is too often missed in stories, it does not provide enough hard data on the risks or benefits of heart implants. It also should have done a better job evaluating the evidence in this study but, instead, left reviewers \u2013 and, we bet, readers \u2013 confused. When a study this large finds that 1 out of every 5 people may have unnecessarily undergone a surgery that led to longer hospital stays in, in a minority, a shorter life, that\u2019s big news. Reporters need to make sure that they give readers the proper context to process findings this dramatic. Identifying the best candidates for ICD pacement is not an exact science. Guidelines have been developed to help clinicians and patients determine the best course of action. The guidelines are, at best, interpretations of existing information generated in clinical trials. While useful, they are by no means exact. The study in question examined data collected from a national registry on over 100,000 patients and concluded that 1/5th of the implants were outside existing guidelines. While the findings in the study are\u00a0troubling at face value, the story appears to be a bit more complicated. The accompanying editorial places the results in a slightly different perspective. Of the four criteria examined, only one (placement of the ICD in patients with severe heart failure) is an absolute. The other three criteria are related purely to timing and not to whether the device is of value. Heart failure patients need the tools to help them ask their doctors the right questions. This story did not provide them enough of those tools.'}\n\nAfter reading:\n\n The story does not describe costs of the drug. The story states that 80 to 95% of women have no bleeding after taking the drug. However, that leaves a lot of open questions about the effectiveness of the drug. For example, how long does this benefit last? What about other symptoms of fibroids like abdominal pain and pressure? The story repeatedly mentions that the drug shrinks fibroids. By how much? Is that difference clinically meaningful? In other words, can women perceive an improvement in bulk symptoms\u00a0(pain, pressure) as a result of the decreased fibroid size? Do the fibroids grow back? The story mentions the potential harm of elevated liver function test results. However, it does not explain\u00a0 that women commonly experience abdominal pain, headaches and nausea with this drug. The story does not critically appraise the current study. This was a small study (57 patients) with a short follow-up time. The results have also yet to be fully evaluated and have only been presented at a scientific conference. The story verges on disease mongering by exaggerating the seriousness of fibroids. While it is true that up to 80% of women may have fibroids, only about 20% of women will have symptoms that are bothersome enough that they would seek treatment. Fibroids in of themselves are benign and are not problematic unless they cause symptoms and treatment should only be initiated if a woman is bothered by them. Symptoms of fibroids also most often go away after menopause. However, this story leaves the impression that all women with fibroids should be treated. The story quoted multiple independent experts. The story mentions Lupron and Uterine Artery Embolization as alternatives to EllaOne but fails to mention many other safe and effective options that are currently available. For example, oral contraceptives (which are not approved for fibroids but are commonly used for that indication) can help reduce bleeding and cramping associated with fibroids. Likewise, the Mirena IUD often stops bleeding altogether. NSAIDs can...\n\nI believe :\n\nPill Treats Painful Fibroids\n\nis\n{'Bot': 'definitely false'}\n\nI  could conclude:\n\nHeart Failure Drug Shows Promise in First Human Trial\n\nfrom:\n\nThere is no mention of the cost for the tested drug, cimaglermin, in this story.

The story would have been stronger if it had detailed exactly what the researchers were measuring when they concluded the drug worked better than placebo. Obviously, if a new drug is found that works effectively to thwart this kind of heart disease, then that\u2019s good news all around, especially if the drug is needed less frequently and is well tolerated, as the story suggests. But care needs to be taken in potentially over-touting the results of these very early trials, and therefore raising the hopes of patients who may be disappointed at a later stage in the research process. Only larger studies with longer follow-up will determine whether these very preliminary results are supported or not. A key outcome to follow will be preventing admissions to the hospital for heart failure, and ultimately, prolonging life.\n\nThe claim is: \nNew Tools for Helping Heart Patients\n\nand the explanation is: \n\"This is a classic story of the potential promise of a new technology\u00a0for the health care sector.

The worst one is the lack of closet space! Some people who eat out all the time use their ranges and dishwashers as storage places because the closets are already full!<br /><br />Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, a great comedy writing team from that era, saw the potential in Eric Hodgins novel, whose hero, Jim Blandings, can't stand the cramped apartment where he and his wife Muriel, and two daughters, must share.<br /><br />Jim Blandings, a Madison Ave. executive, has had it! When he sees an ad for Connecticut living, he decides to take a look. Obviously, a first time owner, Jim is duped by the real estate man into buying the dilapidated house he is taken to inspect by an unscrupulous agent. This is only the beginning of his problems.<br /><br />Whatever could be wrong, goes wrong. The architect is asked to come out with a plan that doesn't work for the new house, after the original one is razed. As one problem leads to another, more money is necessary, and whatever was going to be the original cost, ends up in an inflated price that Jim could not really afford.<br /><br />The film is fun because of the three principals in it. Cary Grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and makes the most out of Jim Blandings. Myrna Loy, was a delightful actress who was always effective playing opposite Mr. Grant. The third character, Bill Cole, an old boyfriend of Myrna, turned lawyer for the Blandings, is suave and debonair, the way Melvin Douglas portrayed him. One of the Blandings girls, Joan, is played by Sharyn Moffett, who bore an uncanny resemblance to Eva Marie Saint. The great Louise Beavers plays Gussie, but doesn't have much to do.<br /><br />The film is lovingly photographed by James Wong Howe, who clearly knew what to do to make this film appear much better. The direction of H.C. Potter is light and he succeeded in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies.

It's the romance of an ex-alcoholic unemployed man who just came out of a big depression and a single middle-aged woman who works in an employment office (INEM). I found the story very simple and full of clich\u00e9s, taking the 'social' theme of the movie and turn it in to a romance comedy. The lead actor did a good job, he definitely looks like an alcoholic man, but Ana Belen is not believable as a working class woman, she looks, acts and talks very much like a 'high-standing' woman. What I mean is that Ana Belen plays herself. She does it in all her movies anyway. The whole mise-en-scene of the film was very poor. The photography is ugly, not using well at all the panoramic aspect ratio. The dialogue sounds totally scripted and dull most of the times. The comic situations are typical from Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not funny at all and are resolved poorly. In my opinion this film is not worth watching. Only if you really love Pereira's previous films you might enjoy this one a little bit. Anyway, I walked out of the theater because I felt I was wasting my time. The film-maker was by the door. I wonder what a director feels like when he sees someone walking out of one of his films, specially one that is made to please everybody. What is the sentiment expressed by the reviewer for the movie?\nBOT: negative\n\n((NB: Spoiler warning, such as it is!))<br /><br />First off, this is a teen slasher flick -- the Spam-In-A-Cabin genre, as Joe Bob Briggs piquantly put it. If you're looking for Roshambo, this isn't it and wasn't going to BE it. I'm desperately unimpressed by stabs at its cinematography, directing or acting performances.<br /><br />Secondly, this wasn't Zuniga's first horror flick, it was her first screen appearance period, cinema, TV, whatever. For what it is worth; neither is Daphne Zuniga Susan Sarandon or Katherine Hepburn.<br /><br />Thirdly, you have to give even a lame slasher flick props. Sure, it follows the deeply insulting formulaic message of its genre: any young woman having or showing interest in sex is beef on the hoof, and the harvest time is now.<br /><br />Except this one gives the chop to the sweet, virginal protagonist as well! Now THERE is a mediocre teen death film that has the courage of its convictions! Interesting that this was said ingenue's only film role. Another One Hit Wonder, except that term gives the lass too much credit.<br /><br />(Then again, this film probably has one of the highest percentage of one-movie actors in history. Of the nineteen credited actors, a whopping thirteen never appeared in any other film. Three appeared in one other movie by the same producers. Only one other besides Zuniga has as many as six screen credits. What was this, the Has Been And Never Were Mutual Aid Society?)<br /><br />Granted, I saw this a long time ago on late night cable when I was bored and never anticipate being that bored in my life again, but I see no reason to hunt down everyone involved and toss them in the incinerator with Joanne.<br /><br />2/10.

What is the sentiment expressed by the reviewer for the movie?\nBOT: positive\n\nI saw this film recently in a film festival. It's the romance of an ex-alcoholic unemployed man who just came out of a big depression and a single middle-aged woman who works in an employment office (INEM). I found the story very simple and full of clich\u00e9s, taking the 'social' theme of the movie and turn it in to a romance comedy. The lead actor did a good job, he definitely looks like an alcoholic man, but Ana Belen is not believable as a working class woman, she looks, acts and talks very much like a 'high-standing' woman. What I mean is that Ana Belen plays herself. She does it in all her movies anyway. The whole mise-en-scene of the film was very poor. The photography is ugly, not using well at all the panoramic aspect ratio. The dialogue sounds totally scripted and dull most of the times. The comic situations are typical from Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not funny at all and are resolved poorly. In my opinion this film is not worth watching. Only if you really love Pereira's previous films you might enjoy this one a little bit. Anyway, I walked out of the theater because I felt I was wasting my time. The film-maker was by the door.

Never having boarders before, the Liscom family, accepted the Jamesons when they came to town in search for a place to stay. Their arrival caused a great commotion as the Jamesons son, Cobb, saw smoke inside his new temporary residence and proceeded to run outside and yell \u201cFire!\u201d Word quickly traveled down the street and a crowd formed outside the Liscom's as firemen drenched the entire house. Mrs. Caroline Liscom was furious that her house was soaked with water when the smoke was only caused by her chimney, and as a result was rude to her new boarders. Mrs. Jameson tried to find a new place to live in response to her host's rudeness, but had no such luck and both families were forced to live under the roof for the next several weeks.\nThe Jamesons consisted of a mother, a father, two daughters, one son and a grandmother. Mrs. Jameson quickly gave her family a bad reputation at a Linnville annual picnic several days after her arrival. She made an announcement to the village that their unhealthy foods were \u201cpoison\u201d and further insults them as she says that their rich pies and cakes causes the insanity and dyspepsia in people of their social class, so they should only eat the health foods she consumes. In attempt to avoid an altercation, the people of Linnville respond as politely as possible and continue on with the picnic as though nothing happened.\nMrs. Jameson proceeds to insult the women of the village at their next meeting - the Ladies' Sewing Circle. It is at this meeting that the women become aware that Mrs. Jameson is trying to improve the women as she interrupts the meeting to \u201cimprove their minds and enlarge their spheres\u201d by reading passages from Robert Browning. The women are not entertained by her reading, but once again are respectful when she is done lecturing them.\nSeveral weeks later, the Jamesons return to the city for the winter and the next chapter begins their second summer in Linnville. For...\n\nQuestion: What do the residents of Linnville pride themselves on?\nBot: Lack of tourism and lack of a hotel.\n\nAnswer the question using the information given in the synopsis below.\n\n After having led numerous military battles against the English during the Hundred Years' War, Joan of Arc is captured near Compiegne and eventually brought to Rouen, Normandy to stand trial for heresy by French clergymen loyal to the English.\nOn 30 May 1431 Joan is interrogated by the French clerical court. Her judges try to make her say something that will discredit her claim or shake her belief that she has been given a mission by God to drive the English from France, but she remains steadfast. One or two of them, believing that she is indeed a saint, support her. The authorities then resort to deception. A priest reads a false letter to the illiterate prisoner supposedly from King Charles VII of France, telling her to trust in the bearer. When that too fails, Joan is taken to view the torture chamber, but the sight, though it causes her to faint, does not intimidate her.\nWhen she is threatened with burning at the stake, she finally breaks and allows a priest to guide her hand in signing a confession. However, the judge then condemns her to life imprisonment.\nAs the jailer shaves her head, she realises she has been unfaithful to God. She demands that the judges return and she recants her confession.\nAs more and more around her begin to recognise her true faith and calling she is permitted a final communion mass. She is then dressed in sack-cloth and taken to the place of execution. She helps the executioner tie her bonds. The crowds gather and the fire is lit. As the flames rise the women weep and a man cries out \"you have burned a saint\". The troops prepare for a riot. As the flames consume Joan the troops and crowd clash and people are killed. Joan is consumed by the flames but they protect her soul as it rises to heaven.\n\nQuestion: What did Joan think her mission was?\nBot: Drive the English from France.\n\nAnswer the question using the information given in the synopsis below.\n\n In 1876, Prince Leopold Mountbatten, Duke of Albany (Hugh Jackman), is a stifled dreamer. His strict uncle Millard (Paxton Whitehead) has no patience for his disrespect for the monarchy, chastising him and telling him he must marry a rich American, as the Mountbatten family finances are depleted. After his uncle told him that on his \"thirtieth birthday he had become a blemish to the family name\", Leopold counters that the new nobility is to be found in those who pursue initiatives, hence his interest in the sciences.\nOne day, the Duke finds Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber), an amateur physicist (and descendant of Leopold) in his study perusing his schematic diagrams and taking photographs of them. He had seen him earlier at Roebling's speech about the Brooklyn Bridge, after he was laughing at the word \"erection.\" Leopold follows Stuart and tries to save him from falling off the unfinished bridge, only to fall with him into a temporal portal between centuries that Stuart has used to travel to 1876.\nLeopold awakens in 21st century New York City. He is at first confused and thinks that he has been kidnapped. Stuart says that he has created formulae to forecast portals in the temporal universe and that Leopold must stay inside his apartment until the portal opens again a week later. As Stuart takes his dog out, he is injured by falling into the elevator shaft, and is eventually institutionalized for speaking about his scientific discovery. (According to Stuart's books, Leopold's unintentional time travel to the 21st century has caused a disruption of all elevators, on account of his leaving the 19th century before he could register for a patent.)\nLeopold is intrigued by the cynical and ambitious Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), Stuart's ex-girlfriend, who comes to the apartment for her Palm Pilot stylus. He observes that she is a \"career woman\" and that her field, market research, is a fine avocation for a woman and states that he once dated a librarian from Sussex. Kate dismisses him and demands that he take Stuart's dog...\n\nQuestion: What does Kate choose over her career?\nBot: A life with Leopold.\n\nAnswer the question using the information given in the synopsis below.\n\n 9 is a sentient rag doll who appears to be the scientist last creation and the last of his kind, living in the ruins of a decaying, post-apocalyptic Earth. He is first seen making simple constructs out of refuse \u2013 a swinging armature of scrap metal, an upright book with string tied around it, and a dummy rag doll full of tar, though the purpose behind these things is unclear at first. Hunting 9 relentlessly is the Cat Beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's skull for a head. It appears to be guided by a small glowing talisman which it holds in its claws. Sitting quietly, 9 stares into the mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback.\nIn the flashback, 9 searches the ruins with his mentor 5, a one-eyed rag doll. They gather useful bits and pieces and store them in the cloth linings of their own skin. With 9's help, 5 is able to salvage a light bulb and operate it using pieces of wire. 5 gives the functional bulb to 9 for safe-keeping.\nAlmost immediately after, 5 draws the mirrored talisman from inside his chest. It glows green, warning of danger. 5 gives the talisman to 9 then pushes him into cover. Extending a homemade folding spear, 5 steps out to confront the threat. But the Cat Beast circles behind him and snatches him up with a metal pincer, shearing off his right arm. Though he struggles, 5 can not break free, and the Cat Beast sucks 5's soul out through his mouth using its talisman leaving 5 lifeless. Horrified, 9 escapes in panic, almost giving away his location to the Cat Beast by scraping the light bulb against a rock.\n9 is woken from the memory by the warning green glow of the mirrored talisman. Taking the light bulb, which he has attached to the end of a staff, 9 flees into a ruined house. The Cat Beast follows and we see that it has not just taken the other rag dolls' souls: it also wears their numbered skins like a garment. The number 5 shows prominently on its back.\nThe Beast pounces on what it thinks is 9, but which turns out to be a marionette\u00a0\u2013 the dummy created by 9...\n\nQuestion: What does 5's soul do before returning to his rag doll skin?\nBot: He gives 9 a nod of approval.\n\nAnswer the question using the information given in the synopsis below.\n\n Rob Gordon (John Cusack) is a self-confessed music loving everyman with a poor understanding of women. After getting dumped by his latest girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle), he decides to look up some of his old partners in an attempt to figure out where he keeps going wrong in his relationships.\nHe spends his days at his record store, Championship Vinyl, where he holds court over the customers that drift through. Helping Rob in his task of musical elitism are Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black), the \"musical moron twins,\" as he refers to them. Armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of all things musical, they compile \"top five\" lists for every conceivable occasion, openly mock the tastes of their customers, and, every so often, sell a few records.\nRob and the staff have a strong dislike for two shoplifting skateboarder teenagers, Vince (Chris Rehmann) and Justin (Ben Carr). One day, he listens to a recording that they made and offers them a record deal, starting his own label called Top 5 Records. During his off hours, he pines for Laura and does his best to win her back.\nRob soon hears that Laura's father, who liked Rob, has died, and attends his funeral with Laura. Shortly after the reception, Rob realizes he never committed to Laura and always had one foot out the door. This made him realize he neglected his own future in the process. Afterward, he and Laura move back in together again. Rob meets a music columnist whom he soon develops a crush on, but while making a mixtape for her, wonders if he'll always just be jumping rock to rock. Laura meets with Rob in a bar where he explains how other girls are just fantasies, and while Laura is a reality, he never gets tired of her. He then proposes marriage to her, and she thanks him for asking. Later, she organizes an evening where he has the opportunity to revisit a love of his youth: dee-jaying. It is also a celebration of the recently released single by the two delinquents, where Barry's band plays \"Let's Get It On\".

In 1791, Louis is a young indigo plantation owner living south of New Orleans. Distraught by the death of his pious brother, he seeks death in any way possible. Louis is approached by a vampire named Lestat de Lioncourt, who desires Louis' company. Lestat turns Louis into a vampire and the two become immortal companions. Lestat spends time feeding off the local plantation slaves while Louis, who finds it morally repugnant to murder humans to survive, feeds from animals. Louis and Lestat are forced to leave when Louis' slaves begin to fear the monsters with which they live and instigate an uprising. Louis sets his own plantation aflame; he and Lestat exterminate the plantation slaves to keep word from spreading about vampires living in Louisiana. Gradually, Louis bends under Lestat's influence and begins feeding from humans. He slowly comes to terms with his vampire nature, but also becomes increasingly repulsed by what he perceives as Lestat's total lack of compassion for the humans he preys upon.\nEscaping to New Orleans, Louis feeds off a plague-ridden young girl, who is five years old, whom he finds next to the corpse of her mother. Louis begins to think of leaving Lestat and going his own way. Fearing this, Lestat then turns the girl into a vampire \"daughter\" for them, to give Louis a reason to stay. She is then given the name Claudia. Louis is initially horrified that Lestat has turned a child into a vampire, but soon begins to care for Claudia. Claudia takes to killing easily, but she begins to realize over time she can never grow up; her mind matures into that of an intelligent, assertive woman, but her body remains that of a young girl. Claudia blames Lestat for her condition and, after 60 years of living with him, she hatches a plot to kill Lestat by poisoning him and cutting his throat. Claudia and Louis then dump...\n\nQuestion: What does the boy who is interviewing Louis want?",

He is first seen making simple constructs out of refuse \u2013 a swinging armature of scrap metal, an upright book with string tied around it, and a dummy rag doll full of tar, though the purpose behind these things is unclear at first. Hunting 9 relentlessly is the Cat Beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's skull for a head. It appears to be guided by a small glowing talisman which it holds in its claws. Sitting quietly, 9 stares into the mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback.\nIn the flashback, 9 searches the ruins with his mentor 5, a one-eyed rag doll. They gather useful bits and pieces and store them in the cloth linings of their own skin. With 9's help, 5 is able to salvage a light bulb and operate it using pieces of wire. 5 gives the functional bulb to 9 for safe-keeping.\nAlmost immediately after, 5 draws the mirrored talisman from inside his chest. It glows green, warning of danger. 5 gives the talisman to 9 then pushes him into cover. Extending a homemade folding spear, 5 steps out to confront the threat. But the Cat Beast circles behind him and snatches him up with a metal pincer, shearing off his right arm. Though he struggles, 5 can not break free, and the Cat Beast sucks 5's soul out through his mouth using its talisman leaving 5 lifeless. Horrified, 9 escapes in panic, almost giving away his location to the Cat Beast by scraping the light bulb against a rock.\n9 is woken from the memory by the warning green glow of the mirrored talisman. Taking the light bulb, which he has attached to the end of a staff, 9 flees into a ruined house. The Cat Beast follows and we see that it has not just taken the other rag dolls' souls: it also wears their numbered skins like a garment. The number 5 shows prominently on its back.\nThe Beast pounces on what it thinks is 9, but which turns out to be a marionette\u00a0\u2013 the dummy created by 9...\n\nQuestion: What does 5's soul do before returning to his rag doll skin?\nBot: It turns to 9 and nods in approval\n\n<html>\n<head><title>High Fidelity Script at IMSDb.</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"High Fidelity script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"High Fidelity script, High Fidelity movie script, High Fidelity film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Helping Rob in his task of musical elitism are Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black), the \"musical moron twins,\" as he refers to them. Armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of all things musical, they compile \"top five\" lists for every conceivable occasion, openly mock the tastes of their customers, and, every so often, sell a few records.\nRob and the staff have a strong dislike for two shoplifting skateboarder teenagers, Vince (Chris Rehmann) and Justin (Ben Carr). One day, he listens to a recording that they made and offers them a record deal, starting his own label called Top 5 Records.

In 1791, Louis is a young indigo plantation owner living south of New Orleans. Distraught by the death of his pious brother, he seeks death in any way possible. Louis is approached by a vampire named Lestat de Lioncourt, who desires Louis' company. Lestat turns Louis into a vampire and the two become immortal companions. Lestat spends time feeding off the local plantation slaves while Louis, who finds it morally repugnant to murder humans to survive, feeds from animals. Louis and Lestat are forced to leave when Louis' slaves begin to fear the monsters with which they live and instigate an uprising. Louis sets his own plantation aflame; he and Lestat exterminate the plantation slaves to keep word from spreading about vampires living in Louisiana. Gradually, Louis bends under Lestat's influence and begins feeding from humans. He slowly comes to terms with his vampire nature, but also becomes increasingly repulsed by what he perceives as Lestat's total lack of compassion for the humans he preys upon.\nEscaping to New Orleans, Louis feeds off a plague-ridden young girl, who is five years old, whom he finds next to the corpse of her mother. Louis begins to think of leaving Lestat and going his own way. Fearing this, Lestat then turns the girl into a vampire \"daughter\" for them, to give Louis a reason to stay. She is then given the name Claudia. Louis is initially horrified that Lestat has turned a child into a vampire, but soon begins to care for Claudia. Claudia takes to killing easily, but she begins to realize over time she can never grow up; her mind matures into that of an intelligent, assertive woman, but her body remains that of a young girl. Claudia blames Lestat for her condition and, after 60 years of living with him, she hatches a plot to kill Lestat by poisoning him and cutting his throat.

Their arrival caused a great commotion as the Jamesons son, Cobb, saw smoke inside his new temporary residence and proceeded to run outside and yell \u201cFire!\u201d Word quickly traveled down the street and a crowd formed outside the Liscom's as firemen drenched the entire house. Mrs. Caroline Liscom was furious that her house was soaked with water when the smoke was only caused by her chimney, and as a result was rude to her new boarders. Mrs. Jameson tried to find a new place to live in response to her host's rudeness, but had no such luck and both families were forced to live under the roof for the next several weeks.\nThe Jamesons consisted of a mother, a father, two daughters, one son and a grandmother. Mrs. Jameson quickly gave her family a bad reputation at a Linnville annual picnic several days after her arrival. She made an announcement to the village that their unhealthy foods were \u201cpoison\u201d and further insults them as she says that their rich pies and cakes causes the insanity and dyspepsia in people of their social class, so they should only eat the health foods she consumes. In attempt to avoid an altercation, the people of Linnville respond as politely as possible and continue on with the picnic as though nothing happened.\nMrs. Jameson proceeds to insult the women of the village at their next meeting - the Ladies' Sewing Circle. It is at this meeting that the women become aware that Mrs. Jameson is trying to improve the women as she interrupts the meeting to \u201cimprove their minds and enlarge their spheres\u201d by reading passages from Robert Browning. The women are not entertained by her reading, but once again are respectful when she is done lecturing them.\nSeveral weeks later, the Jamesons return to the city for the winter and the next chapter begins their second summer in Linnville.

Her judges try to make her say something that will discredit her claim or shake her belief that she has been given a mission by God to drive the English from France, but she remains steadfast. One or two of them, believing that she is indeed a saint, support her. The authorities then resort to deception. A priest reads a false letter to the illiterate prisoner supposedly from King Charles VII of France, telling her to trust in the bearer. When that too fails, Joan is taken to view the torture chamber, but the sight, though it causes her to faint, does not intimidate her.\nWhen she is threatened with burning at the stake, she finally breaks and allows a priest to guide her hand in signing a confession. However, the judge then condemns her to life imprisonment.\nAs the jailer shaves her head, she realises she has been unfaithful to God. She demands that the judges return and she recants her confession.\nAs more and more around her begin to recognise her true faith and calling she is permitted a final communion mass. She is then dressed in sack-cloth and taken to the place of execution. She helps the executioner tie her bonds. The crowds gather and the fire is lit. As the flames rise the women weep and a man cries out \"you have burned a saint\". The troops prepare for a riot. As the flames consume Joan the troops and crowd clash and people are killed.

His strict uncle Millard (Paxton Whitehead) has no patience for his disrespect for the monarchy, chastising him and telling him he must marry a rich American, as the Mountbatten family finances are depleted. After his uncle told him that on his \"thirtieth birthday he had become a blemish to the family name\", Leopold counters that the new nobility is to be found in those who pursue initiatives, hence his interest in the sciences.\nOne day, the Duke finds Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber), an amateur physicist (and descendant of Leopold) in his study perusing his schematic diagrams and taking photographs of them. He had seen him earlier at Roebling's speech about the Brooklyn Bridge, after he was laughing at the word \"erection.\" Leopold follows Stuart and tries to save him from falling off the unfinished bridge, only to fall with him into a temporal portal between centuries that Stuart has used to travel to 1876.\nLeopold awakens in 21st century New York City. He is at first confused and thinks that he has been kidnapped. Stuart says that he has created formulae to forecast portals in the temporal universe and that Leopold must stay inside his apartment until the portal opens again a week later. As Stuart takes his dog out, he is injured by falling into the elevator shaft, and is eventually institutionalized for speaking about his scientific discovery. (According to Stuart's books, Leopold's unintentional time travel to the 21st century has caused a disruption of all elevators, on account of his leaving the 19th century before he could register for a patent.)\nLeopold is intrigued by the cynical and ambitious Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), Stuart's ex-girlfriend, who comes to the apartment for her Palm Pilot stylus.

In 1791, Louis is a young indigo plantation owner living south of New Orleans. Distraught by the death of his pious brother, he seeks death in any way possible. Louis is approached by a vampire named Lestat de Lioncourt, who desires Louis' company. Lestat turns Louis into a vampire and the two become immortal companions. Lestat spends time feeding off the local plantation slaves while Louis, who finds it morally repugnant to murder humans to survive, feeds from animals. Louis and Lestat are forced to leave when Louis' slaves begin to fear the monsters with which they live and instigate an uprising. Louis sets his own plantation aflame; he and Lestat exterminate the plantation slaves to keep word from spreading about vampires living in Louisiana. Gradually, Louis bends under Lestat's influence and begins feeding from humans. He slowly comes to terms with his vampire nature, but also becomes increasingly repulsed by what he perceives as Lestat's total lack of compassion for the humans he preys upon.\nEscaping to New Orleans, Louis feeds off a plague-ridden young girl, who is five years old, whom he finds next to the corpse of her mother. Louis begins to think of leaving Lestat and going his own way. Fearing this, Lestat then turns the girl into a vampire \"daughter\" for them, to give Louis a reason to stay. She is then given the name Claudia. Louis is initially horrified that Lestat has turned a child into a vampire, but soon begins to care for Claudia. Claudia takes to killing easily, but she begins to realize over time she can never grow up; her mind matures into that of an intelligent, assertive woman, but her body remains that of a young girl. Claudia blames Lestat for her condition and, after 60 years of living with him, she hatches a plot to kill Lestat by poisoning him and cutting his throat.

Never having boarders before, the Liscom family, accepted the Jamesons when they came to town in search for a place to stay. Their arrival caused a great commotion as the Jamesons son, Cobb, saw smoke inside his new temporary residence and proceeded to run outside and yell \u201cFire!\u201d Word quickly traveled down the street and a crowd formed outside the Liscom's as firemen drenched the entire house. Mrs. Caroline Liscom was furious that her house was soaked with water when the smoke was only caused by her chimney, and as a result was rude to her new boarders. Mrs. Jameson tried to find a new place to live in response to her host's rudeness, but had no such luck and both families were forced to live under the roof for the next several weeks.\nThe Jamesons consisted of a mother, a father, two daughters, one son and a grandmother. Mrs. Jameson quickly gave her family a bad reputation at a Linnville annual picnic several days after her arrival. She made an announcement to the village that their unhealthy foods were \u201cpoison\u201d and further insults them as she says that their rich pies and cakes causes the insanity and dyspepsia in people of their social class, so they should only eat the health foods she consumes. In attempt to avoid an altercation, the people of Linnville respond as politely as possible and continue on with the picnic as though nothing happened.\nMrs. Jameson proceeds to insult the women of the village at their next meeting - the Ladies' Sewing Circle. It is at this meeting that the women become aware that Mrs. Jameson is trying to improve the women as she interrupts the meeting to \u201cimprove their minds and enlarge their spheres\u201d by reading passages from Robert Browning. The women are not entertained by her reading, but once again are respectful when she is done lecturing them.\nSeveral weeks later, the Jamesons return to the city for the winter and the next chapter begins their second summer in Linnville. For...\n\nWhat is the answer to the following query?\n\nWhat do the residents of Linnville pride themselves on?\nAnswer: the town's lack of tourism or a summer hotel\n\nAnswer the question using the information given in the synopsis below.\n\n After having led numerous military battles against the English during the Hundred Years' War, Joan of Arc is captured near Compiegne and eventually brought to Rouen, Normandy to stand trial for heresy by French clergymen loyal to the English.\nOn 30 May 1431 Joan is interrogated by the French clerical court. Her judges try to make her say something that will discredit her claim or shake her belief that she has been given a mission by God to drive the English from France, but she remains steadfast. One or two of them, believing that she is indeed a saint, support her. The authorities then resort to deception. A priest reads a false letter to the illiterate prisoner supposedly from King Charles VII of France, telling her to trust in the bearer. When that too fails, Joan is taken to view the torture chamber, but the sight, though it causes her to faint, does not intimidate her.\nWhen she is threatened with burning at the stake, she finally breaks and allows a priest to guide her hand in signing a confession. However, the judge then condemns her to life imprisonment.\nAs the jailer shaves her head, she realises she has been unfaithful to God. She demands that the judges return and she recants her confession.\nAs more and more around her begin to recognise her true faith and calling she is permitted a final communion mass. She is then dressed in sack-cloth and taken to the place of execution. She helps the executioner tie her bonds. The crowds gather and the fire is lit. As the flames rise the women weep and a man cries out \"you have burned a saint\". The troops prepare for a riot. As the flames consume Joan the troops and crowd clash and people are killed. Joan is consumed by the flames but they protect her soul as it rises to heaven.\n\nQuestion: What did Joan think her mission was?\nBot: Drive the English from France.\n\nState the main points mentioned in the below text.\n\n<html>\n<head><title>Kate & Leopold Script at IMSDb.</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Kate & Leopold script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Kate & Leopold script, Kate & Leopold movie script, Kate & Leopold film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

His strict uncle Millard (Paxton Whitehead) has no patience for his disrespect for the monarchy, chastising him and telling him he must marry a rich American, as the Mountbatten family finances are depleted. After his uncle told him that on his \"thirtieth birthday he had become a blemish to the family name\", Leopold counters that the new nobility is to be found in those who pursue initiatives, hence his interest in the sciences.\nOne day, the Duke finds Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber), an amateur physicist (and descendant of Leopold) in his study perusing his schematic diagrams and taking photographs of them. He had seen him earlier at Roebling's speech about the Brooklyn Bridge, after he was laughing at the word \"erection.\" Leopold follows Stuart and tries to save him from falling off the unfinished bridge, only to fall with him into a temporal portal between centuries that Stuart has used to travel to 1876.\nLeopold awakens in 21st century New York City. He is at first confused and thinks that he has been kidnapped. Stuart says that he has created formulae to forecast portals in the temporal universe and that Leopold must stay inside his apartment until the portal opens again a week later. As Stuart takes his dog out, he is injured by falling into the elevator shaft, and is eventually institutionalized for speaking about his scientific discovery. (According to Stuart's books, Leopold's unintentional time travel to the 21st century has caused a disruption of all elevators, on account of his leaving the 19th century before he could register for a patent.)\nLeopold is intrigued by the cynical and ambitious Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), Stuart's ex-girlfriend, who comes to the apartment for her Palm Pilot stylus. He observes that she is a \"career woman\" and that her field, market research, is a fine avocation for a woman and states that he once dated a librarian from Sussex. Kate dismisses him and demands that he take Stuart's dog...\n\n<html>\n<head><title>9 Script at IMSDb.</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"9 script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"9 script, 9 movie script, 9 film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

He is first seen making simple constructs out of refuse \u2013 a swinging armature of scrap metal, an upright book with string tied around it, and a dummy rag doll full of tar, though the purpose behind these things is unclear at first. Hunting 9 relentlessly is the Cat Beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's skull for a head. It appears to be guided by a small glowing talisman which it holds in its claws. Sitting quietly, 9 stares into the mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback.\nIn the flashback, 9 searches the ruins with his mentor 5, a one-eyed rag doll. They gather useful bits and pieces and store them in the cloth linings of their own skin. With 9's help, 5 is able to salvage a light bulb and operate it using pieces of wire. 5 gives the functional bulb to 9 for safe-keeping.\nAlmost immediately after, 5 draws the mirrored talisman from inside his chest. It glows green, warning of danger. 5 gives the talisman to 9 then pushes him into cover. Extending a homemade folding spear, 5 steps out to confront the threat. But the Cat Beast circles behind him and snatches him up with a metal pincer, shearing off his right arm. Though he struggles, 5 can not break free, and the Cat Beast sucks 5's soul out through his mouth using its talisman leaving 5 lifeless. Horrified, 9 escapes in panic, almost giving away his location to the Cat Beast by scraping the light bulb against a rock.\n9 is woken from the memory by the warning green glow of the mirrored talisman. Taking the light bulb, which he has attached to the end of a staff, 9 flees into a ruined house. The Cat Beast follows and we see that it has not just taken the other rag dolls' souls: it also wears their numbered skins like a garment. The number 5 shows prominently on its back.\nThe Beast pounces on what it thinks is 9, but which turns out to be a marionette\u00a0\u2013 the dummy created by 9...\n\n<html>\n<head><title>High Fidelity Script at IMSDb.</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"High Fidelity script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"High Fidelity script, High Fidelity movie script, High Fidelity film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

We believe these products need to be regulated as medicines and will continue to make this point during further negotiations.\nSmoking levels in England are at their lowest since records began  19.5 per cent  but we are determined to further reduce rates of smoking and believe this important step will help.\nThe UK e-cigarette industry, which welcomed the parliaments vote, said it was already in talks with the Advertising Standards Authority but added that it would not be sensible, reasonable or useful to ban all advertising.\nMEPs decided e-cigarettes should only be regulated as medical products if manufacturers claimed they could prevent the smoking of tobacco  a decision criticized by the governments main medicines regulator.\nThey want to put the e-cigarettes, used by an estimated 1.3 million people in Britain, on the same legal basis as gums, patches and mouth sprays, which help smokers to quit, but the industry says that...\"\n{'bot': 'Intermediate'}\n\nHow would you assess the reading difficulty of the text passage below?

I dont think he was unhappy with us, or lonely, because octopuses are solitary creatures. But, he is such a curious boy. He wanted to know what was happening on the outside. Thats just his personality.\nOne theory is that Inky slid across the aquarium floor  a journey of three or four metres  and, then, into a drainpipe that led directly to the sea. The drainpipe was 50 metres long and led to the waters of Hawkes Bay, on the east coast of New Zealands North Island.\nIt is also possible that Inky escaped by squeezing into an open pipe at the top of his tank, which led under the floor to the drain. When we came in the next morning and his tank was empty, I was really surprised, said Yarrell, who has not launched a search for Inky. The staff and I have been pretty sad. But then, this is Inky and hes always been a bit of a surprise octopus.\nReiss Jenkinson, exhibits keeper at the National Aquarium, said he was absolutely certain Inky was not stolen. I understand octopus behaviour very well, he said. I have seen octopuses on boats escape through bilge pumps. And, the security here is too tight for anyone to take Inky and why would they?\nBecause octopuses have no bones, they are able to fit into extremely small spaces and can squeeze through gaps the size of coins.

They thought that the bullet would silence us. But they failed, she said.\nIt was an unusual 16th birthday. Instead of blowing out candles on a cake, Malala sat in one of the main council chambers at the United Nations in the central seat usually reserved for world leaders.\nShe listened quietly as Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, described her as our hero, our champion; and as the former British prime minister and now UN education envoy, Gordon Brown, said what he called the words the Taliban never wanted her to hear: happy 16th birthday, Malala.\nThe event, named Malala Day, was the culmination of an extraordinary four years for the girl from Mingora in Pakistan. She was thrust into the public glare after she wrote a blog for the BBC Urdu service describing her experiences of struggling to get an education under the rising power of Taliban militants.\nBy 11, she was showing exceptional determination, calling personally on the US special representative to Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, to use his influence against the Talibans efforts to stop education for girls. By 14, she was on the radar of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who suggested her for the International Childrens Peace Prize, and, by 15, she became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize nominee in history.\nBut all this global attention came at a price. Death threats followed, and, on 9 October 2012, following a meeting of Pakistani Taliban leaders, the gunman was sent to silence her.\nMultiple operations in Pakistan and the UK followed the attack on the bus, including the fitting of a titanium plate on her left forehead and a cochlear implant to restore her hearing.

A hard winter ahead may be slightly improved because 50 workers will live and work in the village to expand the harbour. But there is an even bigger crisis ahead because the government has said it will end a tax break for islands.\nThe tax break was created to help island communities survive the problem of mass emigration. The lower sales tax reduced the costs of living on the islands, where everything had to be imported and it made tourism more affordable. Tourist favourites such as Mykonos fear that losing the tax breaks will make it hard for them to compete with Turkey. But, for Agios Efstratios, it is a far greater problem.

They did their banking at the post of ce and the few dozen rooms to rent were fully booked every summer with people who had heard  by word of mouth  of its spectacular empty beaches, clear seas and fresh seafood.\nBut, because the island still uses only cash, the closure of the Greek banks has been devastating.

Even people born here and living in Athens, who have their own places on the island, arent coming.\nKakali has badgered the government and a major Greek bank into promising an ATM within weeks but she still feels it may be too late for this season on an island where tourism is the main source of income: We have almost no reservations in August, when usually we have people calling us up asking to  nd a room and we cant help them. A hard winter ahead may be slightly improved because 50 workers will live and work in the village to expand the harbour. But there is an even bigger crisis ahead because the government has said it will end a tax break for islands.\nThe tax break was created to help island communities survive the problem of mass emigration. The lower sales tax reduced the costs of living on the islands, where everything had to be imported and it made tourism more affordable. Tourist favourites such as Mykonos fear that losing the tax breaks will make it hard for them to compete with Turkey. But, for Agios Efstratios, it is a far greater problem.

        "instruction": "The answer to the question: What is the last name of the man who had a memorial concert played in February 1931 after his death in December 1930? death in February 1931? is inside the article: In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \"Bethlehem Down\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory\u2014that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in..., can you guess it ?\n[Answer]\nHeseltine\n\nThe answer to the question: What is the full name of the person Patian agrees to remove the handcuffs for? is inside the article: Taxi driver Joe Lourik gets into an argument with a finance company over payments owed on his new cab. Believing that he has been cheated, Joe reclaims his payments but is arrested for robbery. Escaping with a pair of handcuffs still attached, he jumps on a passing freight train where he meets a tramp who tells him to see Patian, a thief and a fence in San Diego, who can also remove his handcuffs. After meeting Patian, it is agreed that he will remove the cuffs on the condition that Joe drive the getaway car for a bank robbery. After the robbery, Patian sends Joe north to a boarding house in Sacramento to wait for his share of the take, but the boarding house owner informs Joe that Patian isn't good for the money. \nDesperate for bus fare to return to San Diego to get his money from Patian, Joe considers robbing the cash register of the empty storefront of a downtown Sacramento flower shop. Once in the store, clerk Laura Benson emerges from the backroom before Joe can rob the register. Joe falls in love immediately and decides to go straight. With his winnings from a crap game, Joe buys a garage in Amesville and settles down, however, within a year, the police are on his trail. Joe then travels to San Diego to demand his money from Patian, but Patian's thugs force Joe to rob a post office. Desperate, and afraid that he will be caught if he returns home, Joe disappears.\nSome time later, Joe sees a picture of his newborn baby in the newspaper and meets with Laura, who pleads with Joe to give himself up and serve his time so that he can continue his new life. Hearing footsteps, Joe flees from the police who have followed Laura, and Laura is arrested and jailed as an accomplice., can you guess it ?\n[Answer]\nJoe Lourik\n\nThe answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who is the television reporter that brings in a priest versed in Catholic exorcism rites? is inside the article: The film presents itself as an off-air recording of television station WNUF's Halloween special that aired on October 31, 1987. The movie's main plot centers upon Frank Stewart, a television reporter that has decided to broadcast himself live as he and four other people (including the cameraman) investigate the Webber House, the site of the brutal murder of a husband and wife. Donald Webber, the suspected murderer and the couple's son, claims that he was commanded to murder his parents by demonic entities that he accidentally summoned using a Ouija board. Since that day, the house has been reported to be haunted and an anonymous police officer testifies that he and other fellow police officers have witnessed paranormal activity at the house. Frank initially treats the broadcast as a novelty, even going so far as to dismiss the concerns of paranormal investigators Louis and Claire Berger (Brian St. August and Helenmary Ball), as Claire immediately states that the house contains a menacing presence and that they are in danger as long as they are in the house. He tries to dissuade fears by bringing in Father Joseph Matheson, who Frank claims is versed in Catholic exorcism rites, despite the priest's assertion that he only has a perfunctory knowledge of the rites and has never actually performed an exorcism., can you guess it ?\n[Answer]\nFrank Stewart\n\nThe answer to the question: Who are the dog in Fagin's gang? is inside the article: On Fifth Avenue, an orphaned kitten named Oliver is left abandoned after his fellow orphaned kittens are adopted by passersby. Wandering the streets by himself in search of someone to adopt him, Oliver meets a laid-back mongrel named Dodger who assists the kitten in stealing food from a hot dog vendor named Louie. Dodger then flees the scene without sharing his bounty with Oliver. Oliver follows Dodger all throughout the streets until he eventually arrives at the barge of his owner, a pickpocket named Fagin, along with his meal, to give to his friends: Tito the chihuahua, Einstein the Great Dane, Rita the Saluki, and Francis the bulldog.

With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \"Bethlehem Down\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory\u2014that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one.

After meeting Patian, it is agreed that he will remove the cuffs on the condition that Joe drive the getaway car for a bank robbery. After the robbery, Patian sends Joe north to a boarding house in Sacramento to wait for his share of the take, but the boarding house owner informs Joe that Patian isn't good for the money. \nDesperate for bus fare to return to San Diego to get his money from Patian, Joe considers robbing the cash register of the empty storefront of a downtown Sacramento flower shop.

Donald Webber, the suspected murderer and the couple's son, claims that he was commanded to murder his parents by demonic entities that he accidentally summoned using a Ouija board. Since that day, the house has been reported to be haunted and an anonymous police officer testifies that he and other fellow police officers have witnessed paranormal activity at the house. Frank initially treats the broadcast as a novelty, even going so far as to dismiss the concerns of paranormal investigators Louis and Claire Berger (Brian St. August and Helenmary Ball), as Claire immediately states that the house contains a menacing presence and that they are in danger as long as they are in the house.

        "instruction": "This article: In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \"Bethlehem Down\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory\u2014that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the man who had a memorial concert played in February 1931 after his death in December 1930? death in February 1931?, what is it ?\nBOT: Heseltine\n\nFound the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person Patian agrees to remove the handcuffs for?\n\nTaxi driver Joe Lourik gets into an argument with a finance company over payments owed on his new cab. Believing that he has been cheated, Joe reclaims his payments but is arrested for robbery. Escaping with a pair of handcuffs still attached, he jumps on a passing freight train where he meets a tramp who tells him to see Patian, a thief and a fence in San Diego, who can also remove his handcuffs. After meeting Patian, it is agreed that he will remove the cuffs on the condition that Joe drive the getaway car for a bank robbery. After the robbery, Patian sends Joe north to a boarding house in Sacramento to wait for his share of the take, but the boarding house owner informs Joe that Patian isn't good for the money. \nDesperate for bus fare to return to San Diego to get his money from Patian, Joe considers robbing the cash register of the empty storefront of a downtown Sacramento flower shop. Once in the store, clerk Laura Benson emerges from the backroom before Joe can rob the register. Joe falls in love immediately and decides to go straight. With his winnings from a crap game, Joe buys a garage in Amesville and settles down, however, within a year, the police are on his trail. Joe then travels to San Diego to demand his money from Patian, but Patian's thugs force Joe to rob a post office. Desperate, and afraid that he will be caught if he returns home, Joe disappears.\nSome time later, Joe sees a picture of his newborn baby in the newspaper and meets with Laura, who pleads with Joe to give himself up and serve his time so that he can continue his new life. Hearing footsteps, Joe flees from the police who have followed Laura, and Laura is arrested and jailed as an accomplice.\n#Response#\nJoe Lourik\n\nWhat is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who is the television reporter that brings in a priest versed in Catholic exorcism rites? from the following article ?\n\nThe film presents itself as an off-air recording of television station WNUF's Halloween special that aired on October 31, 1987. The movie's main plot centers upon Frank Stewart, a television reporter that has decided to broadcast himself live as he and four other people (including the cameraman) investigate the Webber House, the site of the brutal murder of a husband and wife. Donald Webber, the suspected murderer and the couple's son, claims that he was commanded to murder his parents by demonic entities that he accidentally summoned using a Ouija board. Since that day, the house has been reported to be haunted and an anonymous police officer testifies that he and other fellow police officers have witnessed paranormal activity at the house. Frank initially treats the broadcast as a novelty, even going so far as to dismiss the concerns of paranormal investigators Louis and Claire Berger (Brian St. August and Helenmary Ball), as Claire immediately states that the house contains a menacing presence and that they are in danger as long as they are in the house. He tries to dissuade fears by bringing in Father Joseph Matheson, who Frank claims is versed in Catholic exorcism rites, despite the priest's assertion that he only has a perfunctory knowledge of the rites and has never actually performed an exorcism.\n{'Response': 'Frank Stewart'}\n\nThe answer to the question: Who are the dog in Fagin's gang? is inside the article: On Fifth Avenue, an orphaned kitten named Oliver is left abandoned after his fellow orphaned kittens are adopted by passersby. Wandering the streets by himself in search of someone to adopt him, Oliver meets a laid-back mongrel named Dodger who assists the kitten in stealing food from a hot dog vendor named Louie. Dodger then flees the scene without sharing his bounty with Oliver. Oliver follows Dodger all throughout the streets until he eventually arrives at the barge of his owner, a pickpocket named Fagin, along with his meal, to give to his friends: Tito the chihuahua, Einstein the Great Dane, Rita the Saluki, and Francis the bulldog. Oliver sneaks inside, located below the docks, and is discovered by the dogs. After a moment of confusion, he is then received with a warm welcome. Fagin comes in and explains that he is running out of time to repay the money he borrowed from Sykes, a nefarious shipyard agent and loan shark. Sykes tells Fagin that the money must be paid in three days, under the threat of resolving to violence. Sykes's dobermans, Roscoe and DeSoto, attack Oliver, but the cat is defended by Fagin's dogs. Immediately thereafter, a depressed Fagin returns to the barge, lamenting that he only has three days to find the money he owes Sykes. After the dogs cheer him up, Fagin is introduced to Oliver, and, considering that they all need help, accepts him into the gang., can you guess it ?\n[Answer]\nRita the Saluki\n\nWhat is the full name of the person who tears up a letter that she had been writing?\n\nAnswer the above question based on the context below:\n\nMom and Dad tells the story of Joan Blake, a young girl who falls for the pilot Jack Griffin. After being sweet talked by Griffin, she has sex with him. The girl requests \"hygiene books\" from her mother Sarah Blake; however, the mother refuses because the girl is not yet married.  The girl later learns from her father Dan Blake that the pilot has died in a crash. She tears up a letter she had been writing to him, and lowers her head as the film fades into intermission.\nThe film resumes at the point when the girl discovers that her clothes no longer fit, sending her into a state of despair.  She takes advice from her teacher, Carl Blackburn, who had previously been fired for teaching sex education. Blackburn blames her mother for the problem, and accuses her of \"neglect[ing] the sacred duty of telling their children the real truth.\"  Only then is the girl able to confront her mother.The film then presents reels and charts that include graphic images of the female anatomy and footage of live births \u2013 one natural and one Caesarian.  In some screenings, a second film was shown along with Mom and Dad, and contained images portraying syphilis and venereal disease.  Mom and Dad is believed to have had a number of endings, although most typically concluded with the birth of the girl's child, sometimes stillborn and other times put up for adoption.\n{'answer': 'Joan Blake'}\n\nThe answer to the question: What is the full name of the person that is set up in the vice trade? is inside the article: In 1906 San Francisco, Frisco Jenny Sandoval, a denizen of the notorious Tenderloin district, wants to marry piano player Dan McAllister, but her saloonkeeper father Jim is adamantly opposed to it.
